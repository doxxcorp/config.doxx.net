# Authentication

## Overview

The doxx.net Config API uses token-based authentication. There are no usernames, passwords, or email addresses. Each account can have **multiple auth tokens** with different roles, optional expiration, and security restrictions (IP allowlists, country allowlists, tunnel scoping).

## Token Types

| Token | Format | Purpose | How to Obtain |
|-------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Auth Token** | ~43 character base64 string | Identifies your account. Used for all authenticated API calls. Each account can have multiple tokens with different roles. | Primary token created at [a0x13.doxx.net](https://a0x13.doxx.net); additional tokens via `create_token` API |
| **Tunnel Token** | ~43 character base64 string | Identifies a specific VPN tunnel within your account. | Returned by `create_tunnel` or `list_tunnels` |
| **POW Token** | Variable-length string | One-time human verification token. Proves a real person created the account. | Returned by completing the DOXX POW challenge |

**You cannot create accounts via API.** A human must visit [a0x13.doxx.net](https://a0x13.doxx.net), complete the proof-of-work challenge, and accept the Terms of Service. The auth token from that process is then used for all subsequent API calls. Additional tokens can be created via the [Token Management](endpoints/tokens.md) API.

## Roles

Each auth token has a role that determines what it can do:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **admin** | Full access: account, billing, tunnels, DNS, firewall, token management |
| **net-admin** | Create/delete tunnels, manage DNS, change configs, firewall. No billing or account changes. |
| **read-only** | View tunnels, stats, alerts, DNS records. No modifications. |

Roles are hierarchical: `admin` includes all `net-admin` permissions, which includes all `read-only` permissions. The primary token created at account signup is always `admin`.

## Security Restrictions

Tokens can be restricted with:

- **IP Fence** - allowlist of IP addresses or CIDRs the token can be used from
- **Geo Fence** - allowlist of countries the token can be used from (GeoIP lookup)
- **Tunnel Scope** - restrict the token to specific tunnels on the account
- **Expiration** - optional expiry time after which the token stops working

See [Token Management](endpoints/tokens.md) for details on configuring these restrictions.

## Passing Your Token

The API accepts authentication credentials through four methods, checked in priority order:

### 1. X-Auth Encrypted Header (Recommended)

The `X-Auth` header carries an AES-256-GCM encrypted payload containing the token and a timestamp. This prevents token exposure in server logs and provides replay protection.

**Payload format before encryption:** `token|unix_timestamp`

**Encryption:** AES-256-GCM with a 12-byte random nonce. The encrypted output is `nonce(12 bytes) || ciphertext || tag(16 bytes)`, then base64url-encoded.

**Timestamp validation:** The timestamp must be within 300 seconds (5 minutes) of the server's clock. Requests outside this window are rejected with an expiration error.

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://config.doxx.net/v1/ \
  -H "X-Auth: <base64url-encoded-encrypted-payload>" \
  -d "list_tunnels=1"
```

### 2. x-auth Query Parameter

Same encryption format as the `X-Auth` header, passed as a query parameter. Useful for GET requests or contexts where setting headers is difficult.

```
https://config.doxx.net/v1/?x-auth=<base64url-encoded-encrypted-payload>&list_tunnels=1
```

### 3. doxx_token Cookie

A plaintext auth token stored in a cookie named `doxx_token`. Used by the web portal.

### 4. token Form Parameter (Legacy)

The token passed as a standard form parameter. This is the simplest method and is used in all curl examples throughout this documentation.

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://config.doxx.net/v1/ \
  -d "list_tunnels=1&token=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

## Subscription Requirements

Some API features require an active subscription (Pro plan). When a feature requires a subscription and the account does not have one, the API returns HTTP 402 or 403 with details about which feature is required.

Free accounts can:
- Create tunnels (limited seats)
- Register domains
- Manage DNS records
- Use basic DNS blocking
- Configure firewall rules

Pro accounts additionally get:
- Dedicated public IPv4 addresses
- Additional tunnel seats
- Family sharing (guest seat grants)
- Advanced DNS features
- Tor onion routing
- Geo-spoofing proxy

## Error Responses

### Invalid or Missing Token

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid or expired auth token"
}
```
HTTP 401

### Expired X-Auth Timestamp

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "X-Auth header: X-Auth token expired (age: 450s)"
}
```
HTTP 401

### Feature Requires Subscription

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Pro subscription required for dedicated public IPv4",
  "feature_required": "dedicated_ip"
}
```
HTTP 403

### IP Not Allowed

When the client IP does not match any CIDR in the token's IP fence:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "ip_not_allowed"
}
```
HTTP 403

### Country Not Allowed

When the client's country (via GeoIP) is not in the token's country allowlist:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "country_not_allowed"
}
```
HTTP 403

If the server cannot determine the client's country, the request is allowed by default.

### Token Expired

When the token's `expires_at` is in the past:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid authentication token"
}
```
HTTP 401. Expired tokens can be reactivated by an admin token using `update_token` to extend the expiry.

### Token Revoked

When the token has been revoked via `revoke_token` or account recovery:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid authentication token"
}
```
HTTP 401. Revoked tokens cannot be reactivated.

### Seat Limit Reached

When the account has used all available device seats:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Seat limit reached"
}
```
HTTP 409

## Regional Endpoints

The Config API is available at multiple regional endpoints. If the primary endpoint is unavailable, clients should fail over to a regional endpoint.

| Endpoint | Region |
|----------|--------|
| `https://config.doxx.net/v1/` | Primary (anycast) |
| `https://config-us-east.doxx.net/v1/` | US East |
| `https://config-us-west.doxx.net/v1/` | US West |
| `https://config-eu-central.doxx.net/v1/` | EU Central |

## Request Format

All Config API requests use `POST` with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type. Endpoints are selected by setting `endpoint_name=1` as a form parameter.

```bash
TOKEN="your_auth_token"
API="https://config.doxx.net/v1/"

curl -s -X POST $API -d "servers=1"
curl -s -X POST $API -d "list_tunnels=1&token=$TOKEN"
```
